section{Overview} This reading group will be a second pass at linear
algebra, similar to how a first course in analysis is a second pass at
calculus. We will rigorously work through the following topics: \
begin{itemize} \
item linear spaces and dual spaces; \
item linear mappings and matrices; \
item determinant and trace; \
item spectral theory; \
item inner product space theory; \
item calculus of matrix-valued functions. \
end{itemize}  The reading group will begin on May 19th and end on August
31st (15 weeks). Since we have the whole summer, we will go at a
relatively leisurely pace: maybe five to ten hours a week of work. The
idea is that you would be able to do this even with a full time job.  \
section{Prerequisites} Participants should be comfortable with basic
linear algebra concepts, as one might reasonably have retained from a
first computational pass at the subject. Some experience with
mathematical proof is probably necessary.  \
section{Textbooks} All the books mentioned in this section can be found\
href{https://github.com/shengweiming/Summer-Linear-Algebra/tree/main/textbooks}{here}.  \
subsection{Primary textbook} Let's use as our primary textbook:\
textbf{\
emph{Linear Algebra and Its Applications}} by Peter Lax (RIP). I should
highlight that the book is very fast-paced and takes a more analytic
approach. If people want, we can also switch to a different book at some
point.  \
subsection{Supplementary textbooks} There are many other good textbooks
at this level. Below are the ones I know of: \
begin{itemize} \
item\
textit{Linear Algebra} by Hoffman and Kunze; \
item\
textit{Linear Algebra} by Serge Lang; \
item\
textit{Linear Algebra Done Right} by Sheldon Axler; \
item\
textit{Linear Algebra Done Wrong} by Sergei Treil; \
item\
textit{Finite-Dimensional Vector Space} by Paul Halmos; \
item\
textit{Linear Algebra} by Georgi Shilov; \
item\
textit{Linear Algebra} by Stephen Friedberg et al. \
end{itemize}  \
section{Format} Here's what we will do each week before the meeting: \
begin{enumerate} \
item Work through around ten pages of Lax, as suggested in the reading
schedule. \
item Select one (or two, if it happens) problem that you think is
interesting or difficult. This could be from Lax or from one of the
textbooks above. (See also\
href{https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/IB/LinearAlgebra/}{these example
sheets} and\
href{https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-700-linear-algebra-fall-2013/pages/assignments/}{these
problem sets}.) \
item If it's your turn, prepare to present the proof of two or three
important theorems from this week. \
end{enumerate}  We will meet Sunday 3pm over zoom, for around 90
minutes. Here's how these may go: \
begin{itemize} \
item One person (rotating weekly) summarizes definitions and proofs from
this week. \
item General discussion and Q\
&A. \
item Each participant presents one or two problems for the group. \
end{itemize}  \
section{Reading Schedule} Below is a provisional reading plan. Chapter
and page number refer to Lax. \

# Overview

This reading group will be a second pass at linear algebra, similar to
how a first course in analysis is a second pass at calculus. We will
rigorously work through the following topics:

-   linear spaces and dual spaces;

-   linear mappings and matrices;

-   determinant and trace;

-   spectral theory;

-   inner product space theory;

-   calculus of matrix-valued functions.

The reading group will begin on May 19th and end on August 31st (15
weeks). Since we have the whole summer, we will go at a relatively
leisurely pace: maybe five to ten hours a week of work. The idea is that
you would be able to do this even with a full time job.

# Prerequisites

Participants should be comfortable with basic linear algebra concepts,
as one might reasonably have retained from a first computational pass at
the subject. Some experience with mathematical proof is probably
necessary.

# Textbooks

All the books mentioned in this section can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1chb49hv65hB8ZXcne0Ljfh3viO_SdOmW?usp=drive_link).

## Primary textbook

Let's use as our primary textbook: ***Linear Algebra and Its
Applications*** by Peter Lax (RIP). I should highlight that the book is
very fast-paced and takes a more analytic approach. If people want, we
can also switch to a different book at some point.

## Supplementary textbooks

There are many other good textbooks at this level. Below are the ones I
know of:

-   *Linear Algebra* by Hoffman and Kunze;

-   *Linear Algebra* by Serge Lang;

-   *Linear Algebra Done Right* by Sheldon Axler;

-   *Linear Algebra Done Wrong* by Sergei Treil;

-   *Finite-Dimensional Vector Space* by Paul Halmos;

-   *Linear Algebra* by Georgi Shilov;

-   *Linear Algebra* by Stephen Friedberg et al.

# Format

Here's what we will do each week before the meeting:

1.  Work through around ten pages of Lax, as suggested in the reading
    schedule.

2.  Select one (or two, if it happens) problem that you think is
    interesting or difficult. This could be from Lax or from one of the
    textbooks above. (See also [these example
    sheets](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/IB/LinearAlgebra/) and
    [these problem
    sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-700-linear-algebra-fall-2013/pages/assignments/).)

3.  If it's your turn, prepare to present the proof of two or three
    important theorems from this week.

We will meet Sunday 3pm over zoom, for around 90 minutes. Here's how
these may go:

-   One person (rotating weekly) summarizes definitions and proofs from
    this week.

-   General discussion and Q&A.

-   Each participant presents one or two problems for the group.

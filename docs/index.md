# Overview

This reading group will be a second pass at linear algebra, similar to
how a first course in analysis is a second pass at calculus. We will
rigorously work through the following topics:

-   linear spaces and dual spaces;

-   linear mappings and matrices;

-   determinant and trace;

-   spectral theory;

-   inner product space theory;

-   calculus of matrix-valued functions.

The reading group will begin on May 19th and end on August 31st (15
weeks). Since we have the whole summer, we will go at a relatively
leisurely pace: maybe five to ten hours a week of work. The idea is that
you would be able to do this even with a full time job.
